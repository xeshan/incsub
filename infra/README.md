### ECS Cluster provision with CloudFormation

This repository aimed to design [Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) based infrastructure which provision with [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

For quick you can launch complete infra by click launch stack:

| AWS Region | Short name | | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| US East (N. Virginia) | us-east-1 | [![cloudformation-launch-button](https://ecswithcf.s3.amazonaws.com/launch-stack.jpg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=Incsub-trial&templateURL=https://ecswithcf.s3.amazonaws.com/master.yml) |

## Overview


The repository contains templates that deploy the following AWS services:

 - The [VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html) with public and private subnets.
 - A highly available ECS cluster on two [Availability Zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) in an [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) group.
 - [NAT gateways](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) (one in each zone) to handle outbound traffic.
 - 2 interconnected containers/microservices deployed as [ECS services](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) (WEB and PHP). 
 - An [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/) to handle inbound traffic.
 - [Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html).

####  Deployment/updation & rollback

These CF template to design for not only provision the infrastrucutre but also can use for deployment of new changes.
