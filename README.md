# Incsub trial


## Overview

This repository aimed to dockerise WEB (nginx) and PHP (php-fpm) service AND deploy to ECS which provision ECS infrastructure with CloudFormation

There is two folder

- [docker](docker) : This folder contains Dockerfile which can use to dockerise Nginx and PHP-fpm services.
- [infra](infra) : Infra folder contains the CloudFormation templates which provision ECS cluster.

Dockerise application

- *php* folder contains dockerfile for php-fpm container which is running on 9000 port.  This container also running Memcache on port 11211 and ImageMagick.  
- *web* folder contains dockerfile for Nginx which is running on 80 port and its based on openresty.  This folder also have configuration file.


## Get it up and running

- Clone this repository.

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/xeshan/incsub.git 
```

- Switch to the docker directory.

``` bash
$ cd incsub/docker/ 
```

- Start the stack.

``` bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

if want to run complete structure as daemon (background process) then add `-d`

That's it! You have now local cluster running web and php services.


http://localhost  `will browse from Web container`
http://localhost/info.php  `will browse from PHP container`

### ECS Cluster provision with CloudFormation

This repository aimed to design [Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) based infrastructure which provision with [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

For quick you can launch complete infra by click launch stack:

| AWS Region | Short name | | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| US East (N. Virginia) | us-east-1 | [![cloudformation-launch-button](https://ecswithcf.s3.amazonaws.com/launch-stack.jpg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=Incsub-trial&templateURL=https://incsub-trial.s3.amazonaws.com/master.yml) |

## Overview


The repository contains templates that deploy the following AWS services:

 - The [VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html) with public and private subnets.
 - A highly available ECS cluster on two [Availability Zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) in an [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) group.
 - [NAT gateways](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) (one in each zone) to handle outbound traffic.
 - 2 interconnected containers/microservices deployed as [ECS services](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) (WEB and PHP). 
 - An [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/) to handle inbound traffic.
 - [Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html).

####  Deployment/updation & rollback

These CF template to design for not only provision the infrastrucutre but also can use for deployment of new changes.
